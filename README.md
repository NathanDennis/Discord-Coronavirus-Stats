Results sometimes aren't returned if:
  - The country you requested has no reported cases and therefore isn't in the API dataset
  - There was a typo in the country name
  - The country name is formatted differently in the API data (see below)
  
### Use command !corona (country) for results - message is case insensitive
 
## Requests that may not return results
Some country names aren't formatted as expected in the API dataset

For example, to search for data on South Korea, you need to call !corona S. Korea

Another example - 'America' or 'United States' needs to use the search term 'USA'
